                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-eagle mb-4">
                    <li><strong>Personal Information</strong>: Provided directly by you when signing up, logging in, or updating your profile. This may include your name, email address, and profile preferences.</li>
                    <li><strong>Usage Data</strong>: Information about how you use the app (e.g., stations played, search queries, favorites, listening history) to enhance your experience and recommend content.</li>

                    <li><strong>Authentication and Payment Data</strong>: When using features like subscriptions or account linking (e.g., Firebase Auth, Stripe), we may access authentication tokens or limited billing metadata. Sensitive information like credit card numbers is handled securely by trusted third-party providers (e.g., Stripe) and is never stored directly by us.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-display mt-6 mb-4 text-white">How We Use Your Information</h2>

                <p class="text-eagle mb-4">
                We use modern, industry-standard security practices—including encrypted connections (HTTPS), secure Firebase infrastructure, and access controls—to protect your data. Despite our efforts, no online system can be guaranteed 100% secure.
                </p>
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-display mt-6 mb-4 text-white">Children’s Privacy & Chat Moderation</h2>
                <p class="text-eagle mb-4">
                    Hörgen Radio is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect or store personal information from users under this age. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided us with personal data, please contact us immediately at <a href="mailto:contact@hoergen.com" class="text-eagle hover:underline">contact@hoergen.com</a>, and we will take steps to remove such information.
                </p>
                <p class="text-eagle mb-4">
                    Our mobile app includes a chat feature designed to enhance user interaction. To maintain a safe and respectful environment, we use the Perspective API (a Google-provided tool) to automatically evaluate messages for potentially harmful, toxic, or inappropriate content. This moderation system may process message content in real time but does not store or associate this data with any personally identifiable information.
                </p>
                <p class="text-eagle mb-4">
                    Users under 18 should review this policy with a parent or guardian before using the app. By using our services, you confirm that you are at least 13 years old, or that you are doing so with proper parental consent.
                </p>

                <p class="text-eagle mb-4">Hörgen Radio relies on services such as Firebase (for authentication, Firestore, analytics) and Stripe (for payments).
